It is hard to say anything about the project because I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

I haven't noticed anything that could be improved, so I just want to say that every part of the project is extremely well done and meets professional standards. :)

Good job, team.

P.S. I would recommend using module imports; I feel require is a bit outdated.
